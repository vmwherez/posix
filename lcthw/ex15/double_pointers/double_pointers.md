# Why do I need a double pointer when dealing with strings in C ?

*ChatGPT response:*

In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters, terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). When you use a double pointer (`char**`) for strings, it typically involves handling an array of strings or a pointer to an array of characters.

Here's a brief explanation:

1. **Single Pointer (`char\*`):**

   - A single pointer can point to a single string, and you can access each character in the string using pointer arithmetic.

   - Example:

     ```c
     char* singlePointer = "Hello";
     char firstChar = *singlePointer;  // Access the first character 'H'
     ```

2. **Double Pointer (`char\**`):**

   - A double pointer is often used for handling arrays of strings, like an array of pointers to individual strings.

   - Example:

     ```c
     char* strings[] = {"Hello", "World", "C"};
     char** doublePointer = strings;
     
     // Access the first string "Hello"
     char* firstString = *doublePointer;
     ```
     
- It's also used when dynamically allocating memory for an array of strings using functions like `malloc`.

Using a double pointer allows you to iterate over an array of strings or manipulate multiple strings efficiently.

Here's a basic example of iterating over an array of strings using a double pointer:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char* strings[] = {"Hello", "World", "C"};
    char** doublePointer = strings;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        printf("%s\n", *doublePointer);
        ++doublePointer;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This program prints each string in the array on a new line. The double pointer (`char**`) is used to iterate over the array of strings.
