# posix
C and POSIX things.
Whereas I have a Starlette app (`peregrine`, currently private) with a Preact front lending itself toward Data Science and AI, 
  ...which also involves some orchestration things, containers, databases...
Whereas I have a C/C++/Python DSP effort, lending itself toward audio application development,
  ...which moves toward CMake and a proper IDE...
  
This repo will be collecting my work in C and will use `zsh`, `vim`, and `make`. 
Hopefully I can have a bunch of little examples without need for something like `cmake`. 

Much of this work should be prerequisite to [sine](http://github.com/vmwherez).
It is also notable that my Obsidian notes connect these worlds of all active projects.

## books

I've kind of been flirting with all of these for some time now.

Learn C The Hard Way - Zed Shaw
ThinkOS - Alan Downey
Beej's Guide to Network Concepts (Python)
Beej’s Guide to C Programming 
Beej’s Guide to Interprocess Communication
Computer Science from the Bottom Up - Ian Wienand
The Linux Programmer’s Guide - Sven Goldt et al 

A Programmer’s Introduction to Mathematics - Jeremy Kun (Python)
> Even though it doesn't quite seem to fit... something about this book with its little examples also sort of feels like it belongs here.
> This is a little strange because I don't really intend to get into Dynamic Programming or Competitive Programming whatever other Discrete Math or Algorithms here.
> That would sort of belong in another thing, maybe. Maybe it should expand here. *If you are a recruiter or otherwise inspecting me, please note I passed Google FooBar in 2018.*
